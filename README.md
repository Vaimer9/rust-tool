# Rust Tool

Hi this a rust tool i made for my first rust project it's is basically a command line tool. There will be an OS info part on this and much more too it.

## Getting Started
For this you will need rust and cargo installed to install rust you can go to this [link](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) after you got rust then you do ``` git clone https://github.com/NightRaven055/rust-tool ``` assuming you have git or you can just download the zip file. When you go into the folder do a ```cargo run``` to run it.
